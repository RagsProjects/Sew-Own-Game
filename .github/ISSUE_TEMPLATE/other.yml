        Couldn't find a template that fits your issue? No problem — use this one.
        A maintainer will review it and apply the appropriate labels.

        > 💡 Before continuing, make sure your issue doesn't fit one of the existing templates:
        > - 🐛 **Bug?** → Use the **Bug Report** template
        > - 💡 **Feature idea?** → Use the **Suggestion** template
        > - 🎮 **Engine-specific?** → Use the matching engine template (Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc.)
        >
        > You can find all templates at the [new issue page](https://github.com/RagsProjects/Sew-Own-Game/issues/new/choose).
